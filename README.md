# Real-time Multi-Face Recognition Attendance System
A Python-based attendance system that uses OpenCV for real-time face recognition to mark attendance. This project is designed to streamline attendance tracking in organizations or institutions.
This is a real-time multiple face recognition attendance system. The database of this project can contain information about student/person's information. One can train the model by taking the photo samples and model is able to recognize it.
## **Features**
- Real-time face recognition using a webcam or CCTV feed.
- Captures and stores face samples for training.
- Generates attendance logs for recognized individuals.
- User-friendly interface using Tkinter.
- Secure and efficient attendance tracking.

  ## **Technologies Used**
- **Python**: For the core application logic.
- **OpenCV**: For face detection and recognition.
- **Tkinter**: For creating the GUI interface.
- **CSV**: For storing attendance records.
- **NumPy**: For array handling in image processing.
